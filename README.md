## 📌 Conclusion  

This project analyzes crime data in Los Angeles using Power BI, breaking down over 1.0 million reported crimes into violent crimes, property crimes, and other crimes. By leveraging SQL for data cleaning, DAX for categorization, and Power BI for visualization, I was able to create an interactive dashboard that provides insights into crime trends, seasonal fluctuations, and high-crime areas.

The analysis shows crime peaks in early months, declines mid-year, and rises again in the fall. Downtown LA, Inglewood, and Lynwood are the highest crime areas, while simple assault, burglary/theft from vehicles, identity theft, and simple assault are among the most common offenses.
